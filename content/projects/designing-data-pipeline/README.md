## 🎯 Challenge

**Veridian Logistics** is a mid-size freight company that routes cargo across five regional hubs. Their operations team has been exporting daily activity reports as CSV files from their fleet management system — dispatches, delivery completions, route changes, and vehicle status updates all land in the same flat export every night.

The problem: the file includes both new records and updates to existing ones. When a package status changes (say, from _in transit_ to _delivered_), the system generates a new row instead of modifying the original. Over time, the exported files have started showing the same shipment multiple times at different lifecycle stages — which means any pipeline that blindly loads these records into a database ends up with duplicates and incorrect aggregations.

The CTO has asked you to design a data pipeline that handles this data correctly before it ever reaches a reporting table. She's not asking for a working implementation yet — she needs a **design document** that her team can review, critique, and hand off to an engineer. You've been brought in as the data engineer responsible for the architecture.

> Your technical lead has shared the following brief:
>
> #### Pipeline Design Document — Veridian Logistics
>
> Produce a `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` file documenting the architecture of the ETL pipeline. The document must address:
>
> - **Purpose**: What business problem does this pipeline solve? What are the outputs?
> - **Data format analysis**: The current export is CSV. Is that the right format for this use case? Would a different format perform better at scale?
> - **Data flow diagram**: A visual diagram of each stage from source to destination — extraction, transformation, load, and any intermediate steps.
> - **Deduplication strategy**: The source updates records by adding new rows. How will the pipeline detect and handle these without loading duplicates?
> - **Idempotency plan**: If the pipeline fails mid-load, how does the next run avoid corrupting or double-loading already-processed data?
> - **Execution log specification**: What minimum fields must every pipeline run log so the system can be audited in production?
> - **Robustness criteria**: What separates a pipeline that simply works from one that is production-ready? List at least three concrete characteristics.

This is a design-first exercise. No code will be written. The deliverable is a planning document rigorous enough that another engineer could implement it from scratch.

Think carefully about each decision — format choices, storage choices, and failure handling strategies all have trade-offs. Your document should show that you understand _why_ each choice was made, not just what the choice is.

## 🌱 How to Start the Project

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/designing-a-data-pipeline) or create your own GitHub repository for this project.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine or open it in Codespaces.
3. Update the remote URL if using your own repo.
4. Create the file `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` at the root of the repository and start your design there.

You can use [this Mermaid editor](https://waficmikati.github.io/mermaid/) to build and embed your data flow diagram.

## 💻 What You Need to Do

### Phase 1 — Understand the scenario

- [ ] Read the brief carefully and identify the key constraints: mixed inserts/updates, nightly CSV export, multi-hub operation.
- [ ] List the questions you would ask the client before designing anything (at least three).

### Phase 2 — Design the pipeline architecture

- [ ] Create `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` at the root of the project.
- [ ] Write a **Purpose** section explaining what problem the pipeline solves and what its outputs are.
- [ ] Write a **Data Format Analysis** section. Evaluate the current CSV format: when does it work well, when does it fall short? Would you recommend an alternative (e.g. JSON, Parquet) for any stage of the pipeline? Justify your answer.
- [ ] Create a **Data Flow Diagram** showing every stage: source → extract → transform → load → destination. Label each stage and annotate any key decisions (e.g. "deduplication happens here").
- [ ] Write a **Deduplication Strategy** section. Explain how your pipeline identifies and resolves duplicate records from a source that updates by inserting new rows.
- [ ] Write an **Idempotency Plan** section. Describe what happens if the pipeline fails halfway through the load phase and how the next execution recovers without corrupting data.
- [ ] Write an **Execution Log Specification** section. Define the minimum fields every pipeline run must log (e.g. run ID, start time, rows extracted, rows loaded, status, errors).
- [ ] Write a **Robustness Criteria** section. Name at least three concrete characteristics that distinguish a production-ready pipeline from one that "just works."

### Phase 3 — Review and commit

- [ ] Re-read the document as if you were another engineer who has never seen the scenario. Are all decisions explained?
- [ ] Commit `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` with the message: `feat: add pipeline design document`.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This project requires **no code implementation**. Do not include Python scripts, database migrations, or working ETL code. The deliverable is exclusively the `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` design document.

## ✅ What We Will Evaluate

- [ ] `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` is present, committed, and complete.
- [ ] Purpose section clearly states the business problem and expected outputs.
- [ ] Data format analysis includes a justified recommendation — not just a description of the formats.
- [ ] Data flow diagram covers all pipeline stages and is legible.
- [ ] Deduplication strategy addresses the specific constraint (updates-as-inserts) rather than the generic case.
- [ ] Idempotency plan explains a concrete recovery mechanism (e.g. staging tables, upsert logic, checkpointing).
- [ ] Execution log specification lists at least five concrete fields with a rationale for each.
- [ ] Robustness criteria are specific and actionable — not generic qualities like "good code."
- [ ] Decisions throughout the document include trade-off reasoning, not just conclusions.

> Note: The quality of the diagram and the technical depth of each section matter more than document length. A short, precise document with clear reasoning outscores a long one with vague answers.
