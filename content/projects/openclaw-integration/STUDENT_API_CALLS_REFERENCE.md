# 📡 Student API calls reference (BreatheCode)

_Spanish version: [español](./STUDENT_API_CALLS_REFERENCE.es.md)._

This document summarizes student-oriented endpoints for **4Geeks Academy**: HTTP method, path, parameters, and response shape. It does not include code samples or example bodies; for detailed schemas, use the linked OpenAPI at the end.

> 💡 **Start here**
> If you are automating or integrating anything, read **Authentication** and **Essential prerequisites** first. That will save you 401 errors and empty filters.

## 🔐 Authentication

Most endpoints require a token in the **Authorization** header, with the literal prefix **Token**, a space, and the token value.

The token is obtained by signing in with **POST** `/v1/auth/login` (public).

Endpoints marked as public do not require a token.

> 🚨 **Security**
> Do not share your token in public repos, screenshots, or chats. Treat it like a password: environment variables or secret managers—never hardcoded in the repository.

---

## 🌐 Base URL

In production the API is usually served from **https://breathecode.herokuapp.com**. Other environments may use a different base.

> 📝 **Environments**
> If your bootcamp uses another instance, confirm the base URL with your instructor or technical team before shipping integrations.

---

## 🎯 Essential prerequisites

Before filtering by academy or cohort, resolve:

- **academy_id** — Numeric academy id for the student. Often taken from the first item of **profile_academy** in the current-user response.
- **cohort_id** and **cohort.slug** — Numeric id and textual slug for the cohort. The active cohort is usually the one with **educational_status** **ACTIVE** in the student’s cohort list.

> 💡 **Mental shortcut**
> Think of **academy_id** as “which campus?” and **cohort_id** / **slug** as “which cohort am I in?” Many lists filter better with one or the other depending on the endpoint.

## 📋 Useful enumerations and conventions

### 🎓 Educational status (**educational_status**)

- **ACTIVE** — Currently enrolled.
- **GRADUATED** — Graduated.
- **SUSPENDED** — Suspended.
- **DROPPED** — Dropped / withdrawn.

### ✅ Task status (**task_status**)

- **PENDING** — Pending.
- **DONE** — Completed by the student.
- **APPROVED** — Approved in review.
- **REJECTED** — Rejected; corrections needed.

### 🧩 Task type (**task_type**)

- **LESSON** — Lesson.
- **EXERCISE** — Exercise.
- **PROJECT** — Project.
- **QUIZ** — Quiz.

### 📄 Pagination

Many listings support **limit** (number of results) and **offset** (offset from the start).

### 🔒 Context filtering

Data is usually limited to cohorts the user is enrolled in, per backend policy.

### ⏱️ Rate limiting and caching

Prefer caching stable responses and avoiding bursts of identical requests; exact limits depend on the instance.

> ⚠️ **Do not hammer the API**
> If a script fires hundreds of identical calls per second, you may hit limits or degrade the service for everyone. Reuse in-memory or on-disk data when it makes sense.

### 🙌 Next step?

Open **Swagger**, pick an endpoint you already use in the platform (for example “my tasks”), and compare response fields with what you see in the LMS. That connects this guide to real practice.
