**Before you start**: Read your **[CONTEXT-company.md](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/ai-engineering-syllabus/tree/main/content/contexts)** before writing any code — it defines the telemetry events, KPIs, and entities your pipeline must process.

## 🎯 The Challenge

> 📌 You are building on **your own fork** of the company's **[monorepo](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/ai-engineering-company-project-monorepo)** selected at the beginning of the course — not on a new repository.

The pipeline design document is approved. Now it is time to build it. But there is a fundamental difference between a script that works on your machine and a pipeline that can run in production unattended: resilience.

Your CTO has closed the design ticket and opened the implementation one:

> > **Implementation Ticket — Resilient Data Pipeline**
> >
> > The design is approved. The operations team wants to see the pipeline running, not just documented. Non-negotiable requirements before handoff to production:
> >
> > — The pipeline must tolerate partial failures without interrupting the entire execution.  
> > — Tasks that touch external services must have retries configured.  
> > — The pipeline must be runnable in a Docker container with a defined schedule.  
> > — If a task has already run successfully in the last hour, it must not repeat unnecessarily.
> >
> > Starting point: your `data/pipelines/PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` from the previous day. Implement what you designed.

### What makes a pipeline resilient?

A resilient pipeline is not one that never fails — it is one that fails well. In Prefect, that means three concrete things:

- **Partial failure tolerance**: a failing task does not bring down the entire flow. Prefect distinguishes between critical tasks (whose failure should stop everything) and optional tasks (whose failure should be logged and allow the flow to continue.
- **Smart retries**: tasks that interact with external services (databases, APIs) are configured with `retries` and `retry_delay_seconds` to absorb transient failures without human intervention.
- **Result caching**: if a task already produced a valid result recently, Prefect can reuse it rather than repeating the computation. This is especially useful for expensive transformations.

---

## 🌱 How to Start

1. Run `git pull` on your monorepo fork to make sure you have the latest state.
2. Open your `data/pipelines/PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` — that document is your specification. Implement what you designed.
3. Write your pipeline code in `data/pipelines/`. The main entry point must be named `data/pipelines/pipeline.py`. Use `data/raw/` for input data and intermediate files, `data/process/` for reusable transformation scripts, and `data/eval/` for pipeline validation outputs.
4. Any endpoint that exposes or triggers the pipeline (for example, to query the status of the last run or launch a run manually) must be implemented in `services/`, importing functions and flows from `data/pipelines/` as needed.
5. Install Prefect in your environment: `uv add prefect`.

> **On Docker:** The final deployment packages the pipeline into a container. Make sure your monorepo already has a working `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` from the containerisation module — you will use it as a base.

## 💻 What You Need to Do

### Phase 1 — Flows and tasks

- [ ] Implement the pipeline as one or more Prefect **flows** (`@flow`) following the stage structure from your design: extraction, transformation, and load as a minimum.
- [ ] Each stage must be an independent **task** (`@task`) with explicit inputs and outputs.
- [ ] If your pipeline has optional steps (for example, notifications or secondary exports), implement them with `allow_failure=True` so that a failure in them does not interrupt the main execution.

### Phase 2 — Resilience

- [ ] Add `retries` and `retry_delay_seconds` to every task that interacts with external services (database, APIs). Justify the number of retries chosen in a comment.
- [ ] Implement at least one task with `raise_on_failure=False` to handle failure explicitly in the flow rather than letting it propagate automatically.
- [ ] Add caching (`cache_key_fn`, `cache_expiration`) to at least one expensive transformation task. Explain in a comment what defines the cache key and how long it is valid.

### Phase 3 — Idempotency

- [ ] The load phase must be idempotent: if the pipeline runs twice over the same data range, the result in the database must be identical after both runs. Implement the strategy you documented in your design (upsert, control table, timestamp, or another).
- [ ] Record in the database or in a log file the minimum execution metadata for each run: start time, end time, records processed, final status, and any captured errors.

### Phase 4 — Schedule and deployment

- [ ] Define a **schedule** for the pipeline (interval or cron) that makes sense for your company's data cycle. Justify it in a comment.
- [ ] Create a Prefect **deployment** using `prefect deploy` or the Python API, with Docker as the execution infrastructure.
- [ ] Verify that the pipeline can be triggered from the Prefect CLI: `prefect deployment run <flow-name>/<deployment-name>`.

### Phase 5 — Backend endpoints

- [ ] In `services/`, implement at least two endpoints related to the pipeline: one to query the status and metadata of the last run, and one to trigger a manual flow run.
- [ ] The endpoints must import flows or functions from `data/pipelines/` — do not duplicate pipeline logic in `services/`.
- [ ] The endpoints follow the same authentication conventions and response structure as the rest of your API.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Flow names, task names, table names, and field names must match what is defined in your `CONTEXT-company.md` and in `data/pipelines/PIPELINE_DESIGN.md`. A generic implementation that ignores your company's context will not be accepted.

---

## ✅ What We Will Evaluate

- [ ] The file `data/pipelines/pipeline.py` exists and defines at least one flow with three or more tasks.
- [ ] At least one task has `retries` configured with a value greater than zero and a comment justifying the number chosen.
- [ ] At least one optional task uses `allow_failure=True` and the flow continues executing when that task fails.
- [ ] At least one transformation task has caching configured with `cache_key_fn` and `cache_expiration`.
- [ ] The load phase is idempotent: running the pipeline twice over the same data does not produce duplicates in the database.
- [ ] Each pipeline run records at least five metadata fields (start time, end time, records processed, status, errors) in the database or in a structured log file.
- [ ] A working Prefect deployment exists with a defined schedule and Docker infrastructure.
- [ ] The pipeline can be triggered from the Prefect CLI without errors.
- [ ] At least one endpoint exists in `services/` that returns the metadata of the last pipeline run (status, start time, end time, records processed).
- [ ] At least one endpoint exists in `services/` that triggers a manual flow run, importing the function from `data/pipelines/` without duplicating the logic.
- [ ] The implemented design is consistent with `data/pipelines/PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` — the stages, entities, and resilience strategies described there are reflected in the code.

## 📦 How to Submit

1. Make sure `data/pipelines/pipeline.py`, the endpoints in `services/`, and any supporting files are committed to your monorepo fork.
2. Commit with the message: `feat: implement resilient prefect pipeline`.
3. Push your changes to your GitHub repository and share the URL with your tech lead.
