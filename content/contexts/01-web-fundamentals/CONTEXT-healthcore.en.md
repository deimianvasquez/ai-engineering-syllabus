# CONTEXT.md — HealthCore

## Milestone 1: Your Company's Public Website

_Estas instrucciones están [disponibles en español](./CONTEXT-healthcore.es.md)._

> This document describes your company and the specific situation you're building this milestone for. Read it completely before writing any code. Everything you build must reflect this context.

## Your company

**HealthCore** is an outpatient healthcare services company founded in 2011 in Austin, Texas. It operates a network of 12 outpatient clinics — 9 in the United States (Texas, Florida, and Georgia) and 3 in the United Kingdom (London and Manchester) — offering primary care, specialist consultations, chronic disease management, and preventive health programmes. It employs approximately 200 people and generates around 28 million dollars in annual revenue. HealthCore's competitive edge is accessibility: same-day appointments, extended hours, and bilingual staff at US locations.

## Your department and the problem you must solve

You work in the **HealthCore Digital** team, the internal technology unit created by CEO Dr. Sandra Okonkwo to build the infrastructure the clinical and operational teams need. This milestone was assigned by **Priya Nair**, Head of Patient Experience.

HealthCore's current online presence is a single-page placeholder from 2019 with a phone number and no SSL certificate. Patients in Texas and Florida report that their first impression of HealthCore online makes them question whether the company is real. Meanwhile, the front desk receives unstructured patient enquiries by phone, spending an average of 20 minutes per call just to gather basic information before an appointment can even be considered. Priya needs a professional bilingual website that presents HealthCore's services and locations, and captures structured patient enquiry data so the front desk can follow up efficiently.

## Your stakeholder

**Priya Nair**, Head of Patient Experience

> Hi,
>
> We've been losing patients to competitors not because our care is worse — it's because people Google us and can't find anything credible. We need a real public website, and we need it to work in **English and Spanish**: a large part of our patient population in Austin and Miami is Spanish-speaking, and we have nothing for them right now.
>
> The site should have two parts. First, a landing page that presents who we are, what we offer, and where our clinics are. Second, a patient enquiry form where people can submit their information so our front desk can call them back to confirm an appointment. Right now that process happens entirely by phone with zero structure — it's costing us time and patients.
>
> Use the content and field specifications in this document exactly. Don't invent clinic names, phone numbers, or services — use what's here. And please make it look professional. This is our digital debut.
>
> — Priya

## Language scope

- The website must be fully available in **English and Spanish**. This is not optional — a significant portion of HealthCore's patient population in Texas and Florida is Spanish-speaking.
- Implement language switching using either two separate HTML files (`index.html` / `index.es.html` and `application.html` / `application.es.html`) or a single page with a toggle that swaps content via `data-lang` attributes and JavaScript.
- All labels, error messages, placeholder text, button labels, and success messages must be fully translated. Do not leave any user-facing text in English when the page is in Spanish mode.

## Patient enquiry form fields

The form (`application.html`) is a **patient enquiry form** — not a booking form. Its purpose is to collect enough structured information so the front desk can call the patient back and confirm an appointment. All field `name` attributes are specified below and must be used exactly as written.

| Field                                        | Type     | `name` attribute      | Validation                                                                                                                                          | Required    |
